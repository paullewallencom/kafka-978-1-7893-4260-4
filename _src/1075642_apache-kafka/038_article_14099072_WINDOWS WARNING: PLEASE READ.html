<h4><strong>WINDOWS USERS PLEASE READ</strong></h4><blockquote><p><strong>In the next lecture, do not run the command to DELETE topics</strong></p></blockquote><p>Because of a bug here: <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-1194" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-1194</a>, it doesn't work. I'm actively working with the Kafka Dev team to see if I can get this fixed.</p><p><strong>In the meantime, please do not delete topics. Otherwise your Kafka will crash and you won't be able to do the tutorial.</strong></p><p><strong>A workaround is to launch Kafka inside of a Linux VM and do the tutorial from there. </strong></p><p>Thanks</p>
