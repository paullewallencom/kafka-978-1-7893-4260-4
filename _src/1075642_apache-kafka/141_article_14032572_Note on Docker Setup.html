<h4><strong>Note on Docker Setup</strong></h4><p>Docker is notoriously hard to setup on some machines, and can have obscure bugs. If you don't know Docker at all, I recommend you first learn a bit about it online. </p><p>Running Kafka on Docker is even harder, and requires some deep understanding of Docker and Kafka.</p><p>Thankfully, IÂ have created a project to make things easy for beginners: <a href="https://github.com/simplesteph/kafka-stack-docker-compose" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://github.com/simplesteph/kafka-stack-docker-compose</a></p><h4><strong>Installing Docker:</strong></h4><p>See here: <a href="https://store.docker.com/search?type=edition&amp;offering=community" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://store.docker.com/search?type=edition&amp;offering=community</a></p><p><em>Note to Windows users:</em> Docker is really hard to setup on your machines, may require Windows 10, might require disabling Hyper-V, and tinkering VirtualBox. If you cannot setup Docker, the best help you will get will be on Google. </p><p><strong>Overall for all Windows users but Windows 10, I recommend not to run Kafka in Docker, and use the binaries instead</strong></p>
